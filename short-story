Once upon a time there was a woman who 
liked to sing and dance. 
One day she moved to New York.
and learned how to code. 
She became the most sucessful coder ever. 
Then she created her own company.
And then the purple donkey came to town 
to dethrone her from her corporation! 
But, no! She said "Hell no, you must go!"
